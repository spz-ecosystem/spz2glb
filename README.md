# spz2glb
> Lossless SPZ to glTF/GLB converter for 3D Gaussian Splatting, fully compliant with the **KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression SPZ 2.0 specification**

## Overview
`spz2glb` is an official lightweight tool from the SPZ Ecosystem, designed to convert SPZ compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting models into standard glTF 2.0 GLB format, with zero loss of Gaussian parameters and full compatibility with all native SPZ decoders.

## Key Features
- ✅ 100% lossless conversion, no modification to original Gaussian parameters
- ✅ Fully compliant with KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression SPZ specification
- ✅ Full support for all SPZ compression modes (including spz-entropy)
- ✅ Lightweight, zero extra dependencies, cross-platform support
- ✅ Compatible with all standard glTF 2.0 3D Gaussian Splatting renderers
